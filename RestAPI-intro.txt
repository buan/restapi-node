What is API and REST
API=Application Programming Interface
REST=Representational State Transfer

Suppose you have a TV.It has 2 things a remote and a screen
1)remote is the interface by which you change channels and communicate with TV.
2)TV is the application which you are interacting..So this can be termed as Application Human Interface

So Suppose,youtube is the application and we search videos from our computers through a series of endpoints
youtube.com/search/myvideo

Some popular APIS are uber,youtube,google maps
So these companies expose a set of functionalities from their codebase to be used by other programmers

Now REST:
-It is a set of identifiable properties/guidelines how we should design our APIs
-It has some set of properties
